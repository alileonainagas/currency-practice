_Ça va mes amis!_ The current project it's just me testing new features on _Vite 2.0_, an awesome Front-End tool to build scalable apps from the simplest template, everything went smoothly while I was writing the code, this is a single-function app that allows the user to know the price (in your local currency) of several cryptos. All the data was provided by the _Crypto Compare_ API. _À la prochaine!_
